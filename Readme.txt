This repository consists of tasks submitted by me during  Data Science and Machine Learning internship at The Sparks Foundation. 

Task 1: To Explore Supervised Machine Learning
 The task is to predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. 
Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

Task2: To Explore Unsupervised Machine Learning
The task is to predict the optimum number of clusters from Iris dataset and represent it visually.

Task 3: Explore Decision Tree Algorithm 
The task is to predict the optimum number of clusters from Iris dataset and represent it visually.The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
